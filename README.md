## Abstract

Share market is one of the most important sectors of economic development of a country. Everyday almost
all companies issue their shares and investors buy and sell
shares of these companies. Generally investors want to buy
shares of the companies whose market liquidity is comparatively greater. Market liquidity depends on the average price
of a share. In this paper, a thorough linear regression analysis has been performed on the stock market data of Dhaka
Stock Exchange. Later, the linear model has been compared
with random forest based on different metrics showing better
results for random forest model. However, the amount of individual significance of different factors on the variability of
stock price has been identified and explained. This paper also
shows that the time series data is not capable of generating a
predictive linear model for analysis.
